        <p>Hello Everyone. I am currently a student at City College of San Francisco. My hobbies are mostly  cooking, gaming, listening to music and reading/writing. I aspire to go into game design. As of now I currently seek to develop competency in object oriented programming. I know basic HTML CSS and Javascript, which I haven't used in over a year, but currently gettting back on track. </p>
